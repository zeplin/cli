## Contribution Workflow

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for external contributions, all code changes happen through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
    - We use jest as testing suite, run `npm test` to test the package
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Create your PR into `develop` branch

## Code Style
We use ESLint as linter. Please ensure that commits on your PR  adhere to ESLint rules. Suggestions are welcome to include/exclude rules on ESLint configuration. [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is configured to run `npm run lint` as pre-commit hook for convenience.
